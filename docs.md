# This is documentation for go-dota2
# Updated: 14.03.25
Note: Since the library (in theory) has all of the dota 2 GC functions integrated (thanks to apigen), this documentation isn't complete and never will be complete. As of now, it provides basic information on how to update generated code and how to generate protobufs.
Most of the client-to-gc functions can be found in "client_generated.go" file.
